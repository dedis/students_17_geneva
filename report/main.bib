abstract="In this paper we propose efficient two-round k-out-of-n oblivious transfer schemes, in which R sends O(k) messages to S, and S sends O(n) messages back to R. The computation cost of R and S is reasonable. The choices of R are unconditionally secure. For the basic scheme, the secrecy of unchosen messages is guaranteed if the Decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. When k=1, our basic scheme is as efficient as the most efficient 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer scheme. Our schemes have the nice property of universal parameters, that is each pair of R and S need neither hold any secret key nor perform any prior setup (initialization). The system parameters can be used by all senders and receivers without any trapdoor specification. Our k-out-of-n oblivious transfer schemes are the most efficient ones in terms of the communication cost, in both rounds and the number of messages.",
